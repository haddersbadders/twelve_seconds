<h1>Twelve seconds</h1>
<h2>A Sheffield diver's road to Rio</h2>

<section class="start content">

 <h3> <p>Standing on the springboard, toes curled in anticipation, I'm hyper-aware of the crowd watching me. I feel the judges' eyes on me and my heart races. Soon I’ll be in the water, knowing whether I nailed this dive or not. But that moment feels impossibly far away. </p>

  <p>I try to focus, because losing concentration can be dangerous - even fatal. I watched a Korean competitor get 'lost in the air' practising a dive off the 10m board earlier. Somersaulting through the air, she lost track of which way was up. Instead of hitting the water hands or toes first, she smacked into the pool on her side. She was taken away in a wheelchair.</p>

<p>I draw a deep breath to snap myself out of the spiral of panic, and hurl myself off the edge of the board.</p> </h3>

<p> Freddie Woodward has been making a splash in the diving world since he was talent-spotted at his Sheffield primary school at the age of seven. Experts tested thousands of children, whittling the group down until they had an elite squad of around ten. </p>
<p> Some kids were crossed off the list for being unable to do more than five pull-ups; others failed a flexibility test; and some were dismissed simply for slouching. The coaches were hunting for a body frame that could withstand intense training to be moulded into diving perfection. </p>
<p> Woodward ticked all the boxes. Sessions held twice a week at Ponds Forge International Sport Centre soon ramped up a gear, until he was training for three hours every day after school. </p>

<h5>The Elite Squad train at Ponds Forge</h5>

<section class="content">
<p>'It was never recreational,' Woodward muses as he hangs around by the Ponds Forge pool in his lunch break. 'From day one, it's about elite performance… From the start it was "We think you’re talented, we want to take you to that end goal, which is the Olympics".'</p>
  <p>Thirteen years on, that ultimate achievement has suddenly come within reach. After a tough off-season fighting niggling injuries, Woodward surprised himself in the National Cup this January. He picked up the gold medal in the 1m springboard event, and silver in the 3m synchronised competition with partner Jack Haslam.</p>
  <p> Alexei Evangulov, National Performance Director for Team GB’s diving squad, told Woodward’s father that if Woodward won his third competition, they’d take him to compete in the Diving World Cup in February. Such an opportunity to get into British Diving’s good books meant Woodward's National Cup performance could be make or break for his Olympic chances. </p>

<h5>Woodward describes why diving competitions are 'terrifying'</h5>
<section class="start content">
<p> Sipping ginger beer in a café a stone's throw from Ponds Forge, Mark Woodward explains the importance of resisting giving Freddie tips at such crucial moments. 'That's not what he wants to hear from you,' Mark tells himself, stressing his words by pounding the table with his hand. 'You’re his dad. Butt out.' </p>
<p> His fist makes the cutlery rattle. 'Don’t get anxious, because if you're anxious, he'll pick up on it, and that'll add more pressure.'</p>

<h5>Mark shares some family snaps as he explains what it's like to bring up a sporting champion</h5>

<section class="start content"><p>But Mark couldn't conceal his nerves when his son climbed the steps to begin his 3m individual event. Diving competitions involve executing six dives, each lasting around two seconds.</p>
<p>Twelve seconds separate success from failure.</p>
<p>'Watching that final comp was one of the most stressful experiences in my life. I can see him now on the end of the board.' Mark's eyes fill with tears, and he apologises before gathering himself to explain his overwhelming pride.</p>
<p>'Just getting ready to do that first dive. The stress, the immensity of that challenge… and he stuck it in for the best part of 80 points. And it was brilliant.'</p>

<p> Woodward secured the gold medal and his ticket to the World Cup. He performed consistently well despite feeling daunted by his first world event and by seeing a Korean competitor get badly injured in the warm up. He made the semi-final, earning Team GB a place in the Olympic individual 3m springboard competition. </p>
<p> But this road to the Rio Olympics has some potholes. Although Woodward won a place for someone on Team GB to compete in the Games, that someone will not necessarily be him.</p>
<p> If Woodward is to board a plane to Brazil this summer, he needs to impress at the Olympic trials in June. Doing that will involve beating his rival, 23-year-old Chris Mears. </p>
<blockquote class="left">
  'I've beaten him twice in a row and I think people see the potential in me' - Freddie Woodward
</blockquote>
<p> 'Leading into this year Chris would have been the guy for the job,' Woodward explains. 'He's already been in an individual Olympic final and a synchro final, and he'll be in the synchro at this year's Games anyway' (with partner Jack Laugher).</p>
<p>'At this stage Chris would still be rated as perhaps a higher calibre of diver. But I've beaten him twice in a row and I think people see the potential in me.'</p>

<section class="start content">
<p>Woodward exudes confidence when he talks about beating Mears to the Olympic spot – but this could all be mind games. Mental preparation plays a huge part in diving, which has often been a source of misery for Woodward.</p>
<p>'I over-analyse things. In a lot of ways it can work to your favour because being a perfectionist you might reach perfection – but it can really hold you back as well.'</p>
<p>Coach Tom Owens agrees Woodward’s mind-set is sometimes debilitating. 'There’s a line between perfectionism and just being hard on yourself, and sometimes that line, for Fred, is a challenge. And it always has been.'</p>
<p>A steady stream of injuries and mishaps between the ages of 13 and 15 meant Woodward hardly dived at all in that time, watching his peers progress as his skills stagnated. He broke his wrist twice, had a stress fracture in his hip, had appendicitis, fractured his foot, and was hospitalised for a week after a bacterial sinus infection developed dangerously close to his brain. But when Owens started coaching him, Woodward soared back to the top.</p>

<h5>Woodward stays hydrated as coach Tom Owens thinks about what set of dives to give him next</h5>
</figure>
<p>'I've watched Fred become more stable and emotionally secure and confident through that journey,' Owen's explains, 'to the point we're at now which means he can go to the World Cup and stand against the world's best divers.' </p>
<p>The next competition for Woodward to focus on is the European Championships, taking place in London in May.</p>
